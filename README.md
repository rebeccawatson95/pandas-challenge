I've been asked to analyze district-wide standardized test results. I wase given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task was to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance. Below are some of my findings.

After compiling the data from both the student and school dataset, I was able to conclude a few things. The first thing that stood out to me is that district wide, students tend to do better at engish than they do math. Yet, when I took a closer look and separated the data out by school, I saw that there are a few schools where the percent of students passing math is in the 90's and much closer to that of english. This tells me that there is a large difference between various schools and how well students do at math. 

Another thing I noticed was after sorting the schools in order of percent overall passing. What stands out to me is that all top 5 schools are charter schools, and the bottom 5 schools are district schools. When divided by grade, I noticed that there is little difference between what grade a student is and wwhat their reading and math scores are. What seems to matter more is what school they go to. 

Lastly, test scores based on diferent factors might have an impact. The amount a school has for spending on each student looks like it might have a slight impact. The more money a school has per student, the better the test scores. The school size does not seem to make an impact between a small and a medium school, but once we look at the test scores of a large school, the scores drop significantly. Finally, scores by school type does have an impact; charter schools do much better with test scores than district schools.
