After compiling the data from both a student and a school dataset, I was able to conclude afew things. The first thing that stood out to me is that district wide, students tend to do better at engish thanthey do math. Yet, when I took a closer look and separated the data out by school, I saw that there are a few schools where the percent of students passing math is in the 90's and much closer to that of english. This tells me that there is a large difference betwen schools of how well students do at math. 

Another thing I noticed was after sorting the chools in order of percent overall passing. What stands out to me is that all top 5 schools are charter schools, and the bottom 5 schools are district schools. When divided by grade, I noticed that there is little difference between what grade a student is and wwhat their reading and mah scores are. What seems to matter more is what school they go to. 

lastly test scores based on diferent factors might have an impact. The amount a school have for spending on each student looks like it might have a slight impact. The more money a school has per student, the better the test scores. The school size does not seem to make an impact between a small and a medium school, but once we look at the test scores of a large scool, the scores drop significantly. Finally, scores by school type does have an impact; charter schools do much better with testscores than district schools.
